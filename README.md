# TDD Training

This repo is for TDD ensemble programming training that
I am going to be running. Participants will be expected
to share their screens and their audio and must be willing
to pair program with other participants.

To participate in the training
you need to have the following:

* a [GitHub](https://github.com) account
* the [mob.sh](https://mob.sh) ensemble programming tool installed
* [Zoom](https://zoom.us) installed to allow us to do screen-sharing 
* PHP 7.4 or greater installed to work from the command-line
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed

The process for the training is going be participants taking
turns acting as a Driver or a Navigator.

A Driver is the person who is sharing their screen and using their
preferred code editor (use one you are comfortable with!) to write
code and run the test suite. The Navigator is guiding the Driver
through the process.

Each turn lasts about 5 minutes (not including switching who shares
the screen and getting other house-keeping tasks taken care of).

We're going to run anywhere from 90-105 minutes followed by some
time discussing the exercise and the outcomes.

As the Facilitator, I reserve the right to remove participants if
their behaviour is disruptive to the core idea that this is a learning
experience and to be compassionate and curious. Participants who are
removed for this reason will not have their money refunded.
